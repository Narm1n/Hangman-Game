## Hangman Game

Aysu Abdullayeva, Narmin Gulamova

This project implements a classic Hangman word-guessing game, where the player attempts to guess a hidden word one letter at a time within a limited number of attempts. The game provides interactive feedback, tracks incorrect guesses, and visually represents progress as the game advances.

The project is designed to strengthen programming fundamentals, including control flow, string manipulation, user input handling, and basic game logic.
